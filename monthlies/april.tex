For integers $x$ and $y$, prove that the last two digits of $31x+73y$ are 18 if and only if the last two digits of $33x+39y$ are 74.


\item % PP-2005-6
$ABCD$ is a rectangle, with points $X$ and $Y$ on sides $AB$ and $BC$ respectively. If the areas of triangles $AXD$, $XBY$ and $YCD$ are $a$, $b$ and $c$, respectively, determine the area of triangle $DXY$ in terms of $a$, $b$ and $c$.

\item % DB-2012-6
In how many ways can you place 16 rooks on a chessboard such that each row contains exactly 2 rooks and each column contains exactly 2 rooks?


\item % Liam & Dylan
Let $(F_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ be a sequence of real numbers such that $F_1 = 1$, $F_2 = 3$ and \[F_{n+1} = \sqrt{F_{n}F_{n+2} +(-1)^n \cdot 5} \qquad \textrm{for all}\quad n\in\mathbb{N}.\] Prove that $F_n$ is an integer for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$.


\item % JM-2011-1
Show that $\displaystyle \frac{a}{b} +\frac{b}{a} +\frac{c}{d} +\frac{d}{c}$ assumes infinitely many integer values for positive integers $a,b,c,d$ such that $a$ and $b$ have no common divisors and $c$ and $d$ have no common divisors.
