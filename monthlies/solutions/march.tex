%For a positive integer that is not a power of 2, define $t(n)$ as the greatest odd divisor of $n$ and $r(n)$ as the smallest odd divisor of $n$ greater than 1. Determine all positive integers $n$ which are not powers of 2 and satisfy
%	\[ n = 3t(n)+5r(n).\]
Let $n = 2^{k(n)} \cdot t(n)$. Note that $r(n)$ divides $t(n)$, and so we can
write $t(n) = s(n) r(n)$ for some natural number $s(n)$. The condition $n =
3t(n) + 5r(n)$ is then equivalent to
\[
    2^{k(n)} s(n) r(n) = 3 s(n) r(n) + 5r(n),
\]
or, equivalently,
\[
    2^{k(n)} s(n) = 3s(n) + 5.
\]

If $k(n) \leq 1$, then we have that
\[
    2^{k(n)} s(n) \leq 2s(n) < 3s(n) + 5
\]
since $s(n)$ is positive, and so we have no solutions in this case.

If $k(n) = 2$, then the equation is equivalent to $4s(n) = 3s(n) + 5$, which
gives us that $s(n) = 5$. Since $s(n) = 5$ is an odd divisor of $n$, we then
require that $r(n) \leq 5$, and so $r(n) \in \{3, 5\}$. Recalling that
\[
    n = 2^{k(n)} s(n) r(n) = 2^2 \cdot 5 \cdot r(n) = 20 r(n),
\]
we thus find the solutions $n = 60$ and $n = 100$.

Finally, if $k(n) \geq 3$, then we have that
\[
    3s(n) + 5 = 2^{k(n)} s(n) \geq 8 s(n) = 3s(n) + 5s(n) \geq 3s(n) + 5,
\]
and, since equality occurs, we must have that $k(n) = 3$ and $s(n) = 1$.
Recalling that
\[
    n = 2^{k(n)} s(n) r(n) = 2^3 \cdot 1 \cdot r(n) = 8r(n),
\]
and noting that $r(n)$ is a prime number, we thus find the family of solutions
$n = 8p$ where $p$ is a prime number.

All solutions are thus given by $n = 60$, $n = 100$, and $n = 8p$ where $p$ is
an odd prime number.


\item % PP-2005-3
%$ABCD$ is a square. At $B$, another square $BEFG$ is drawn so that $\angle ABE$ is obtuse. Prove that the median through $B$ of triangle $BCG$ is perpendicular to $AE$.


\item % PP-2006-3
%A hexagon can be partitioned into triangles, each coloured either black or white, such that:
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Every two triangles either share a common side (and then they are of different colours) or a common vertex, or else they have no points in common.
%\item Every side of the hexagon is also a side of one of the black triangles.
%\end{enumerate}

\item % SW-2013-4
%Determine all pairs of functions $(f,g)$ from the set of real numbers to itself such that
%\[ \min(f(x),f(y)) = \max(g(x),g(y)) \]
%for all real numbers $x$ and $y$ with $x \neq y$.


\item % Argentine National Olympiad 2016 1st Level Q2 -- C, Q4
%Given 100 infinitely large boxes with finitely many markers in each of them, the following procedure is carried out: At step 1 one adds one marker in every box. At step 2 one marker is added in every box containing an even number of markers. At step 3 one marker is added in every box in which the number of markers is divisible by 3, and so on. Before the process starts Bruno wants to distribute several markers in the boxes such that there is at least one marker in each box and the following holds: after any number of steps there exist two boxes containing a different number of markers. Is it possible for Bruno to do this?


\item % SW-2009-6
%Let $n > 1$ be an integer. Prove that the inequality
%\[ \frac{(n-1)^2}{4} \geq \left(\sum_{1 \leq i < j \leq n} \sqrt{x_i x_j}\right)^2 + \left(\sum_{1 \leq i < j \leq n} \left\lvert x_i-x_j \right\rvert \right)^2 \]
%holds for all nonnegative real numbers $x_1, x_2, \dotsc, x_n$ with $x_1 +x_2 +\dotsb +x_n = 1$.

%$\triangle ABC$ is right-angled with $\angle A=90^\circ$ and circumcircle $\Gamma$. The incircle of $\triangle ABC$ touches $BC$ at $D$, $CA$ at $E$ and $AB$ at $F$. Let $M$ be the midpoint of arc $AB$ of $\Gamma$ not containing $C$ and let $N$ be the midpoint of arc $AC$ of $\Gamma$ not containing $B$. Prove that $E$, $F$, $M$ and $N$ lie on a straight line.


\item % JM-2007-4
%Let $m,n$ be positive integers and $p > 3$ a prime number such that $\gcd(m,p-1) = \gcd(n,p-1) = 1$, and assume that $(a^m + b^m)^n \equiv (a^n + b^n)^m \pmod{p}$ for all integers $a$ and $b$.
