Given 100 infinitely large boxes with finitely many markers in each of them, the following procedure is carried out: At step 1 one adds one marker in every box. At step 2 one marker is added in every box containing an even number of markers. At step 3 one marker is added in every box in which the number of markers is divisible by 3, and so on. Before the process starts Bruno wants to distribute several markers in the boxes such that there is at least one marker in each box and the following holds: after any number of steps there exist two boxes containing a different number of markers. Is it possible for Bruno to do this?

Determine all pairs of positive integers $(m,n)$ for which
	\[(m+n)^3 \mid 2n(3m^2+n^2) + 8.\]


\item % Easy, Dutch BxMO Selection Test 2016
For a positive integer that is not a power of 2, define $t(n)$ as the greatest odd divisor of $n$ and $r(n)$ as the smallest odd divisor of $n$ greater than 1. Determine all positive integers $n$ which are not a power of 2 and satisfies
	\[ n = 3t(n)+5r(n).\]

For a certain integer value of $n$, the numbers $4^n$ and $5^n$ start with the same digit. Prove that this digit must be either a 2 or a 4.

$\triangle ABC$ is right-angled with $\angle A=90^\circ$ and circumcircle $\Gamma$. The incircle of $\triangle ABC$ touches $BC$ at $D$, $CA$ at $E$ and $AB$ at $F$. Let $M$ be the midpoint of arc $AB$ of $\Gamma$ not containing $C$ and let $N$ be the midpoint of arc $AC$ of $\Gamma$ not containing $B$. Prove that $E$, $F$, $M$ and $N$ lie on a straight line.

Determine the number of sets $A = \{a_1,a_2,\ldots, a_{1000}\}$ of positive integers satisfying $a_1 < a_2 < \cdots a_{1000} \le 2014$ for which the set
	\[ S = \{a_i+a_j \mid 1\le i,j\le 1000,\ i+j\in A\} \]
is a subset of $A$.
