\begin{enumerate}
    
    % QUESTION 1
    \item[1.] Letting $x=y=0$, we obtain $f(0) = 2f(0)$ and so $f(0)=0$. Then letting $x=y$, we find: 
    \begin{equation*}
    	f(0) = 2f(x)-2x^2 \\ \implies f(x) = x^2
    \end{equation*}
    $\forall x \in \mathbb{R}$. Now all that remains is to check that this is indeed a solution. Substituting $f(x)=x^2$ into the original equation gives:
    \begin{equation*}
    	f(x)+f(y)-2xy = x^2+y^2-2xy = (x-y)^2 = f(x-y)
    \end{equation*}
    which holds for all $x,y \in \mathbb{R}$, and so $f(x) = x^2$ is a solution (the only solution).
    
    
    % QUESTION 2
    \item[2.] Let the feet of the altitudes from $X$ onto $BP$ and $AP$ be $E$a dn $F$ respectively, and let the feet of the altitudes from $Y$ onto $DP$ and $CP$ be $G$ and $H$ respectively. Then triangles $XFP$ and $YHP$ are similar since $\angle XPF = \angle YPH$ and $\angle XFP = 90^\circ = \angle YHP$, but $XP = YP$ and so they are in fact congruent; hence $HP = FP$. Also, triangles $BFP$ and $DHP$ are similar since $\angle BFP = 90^\circ = \angle DHP$ and $\angle BPF = \angle DPH$, but since $FP = HP$ they are in fact congruent and so $BP = DP$. Similarly $AC = CP$ and so the diagonals of $ABCD$ bisect each other; hence $ABCD$ is a parallelogram.
    
    
    % QUESTION 3
    \item[3.] Construct a graph where the stations are vertices and the belts are edges. For a toy to continue indefinitely, since there can be at most one directed belt between any 2 stations, there must be a directed 3-cycle or 4-cycle. We count these in cases.
    
    Firstly, consider the complete graph, meaning that all stations have a belt between. There are $2^6$ such graphs (2 choices of direction per edge). Count those without cycles. These must contain a station to which either all belts are directed or all are diverted (a `source' or a `sink'), since otherwise from every station a toy can both enter and exit, and thus there must exist a cycle. There are 4 choices for the station that can either be a global source or a sink. The remaining 3 stations should also not be in a cycle, and thus there must be a station acting as a source or a sink among them, too. However, either it is also a global sink or source, or one of the others must be. So in general, we double count the number of acyclic graphs; hence there must be $\frac{4\cdot2\cdot3\cdot2}{2} = 24$. Thus there are $2^6-24=40$ connected graphs containing a cycle.
    
    Next we consider graphs that are not fully connected. First we look for 3-cycles. There are 4 ways of choosing 3 stations to make a 3-cycle, and each can be a 3-cycle in either direction. The remaining station can either not be connected to any station, be connected to 1 station in either direction (6 ways), or be connected to 2 stations, each in either direction ($3\cdot2^2=12$ ways). In the last case, there is one directed arrangement that will make another 3-cycle, and hence will be double counted. So this gives us $4\cdot2\cdot(1+6+12)-4\cdot3=140$.
    
    Finally, we look for 4-cycles. We can construct these by considering any station and directing it to any other (3 choices); then, in the same direction, the next station can be directed to any of the unconnected stations (2 choices); and the last station must be directed back to the first one. There are 6 ways to do this in total, and these must include all possibilities. If the other edges are left blank, these are the only graphs containing 4-cycles. However, if we add any other edge, in either direction, we must get a 3-cycle, and so these have been counted already.
    
    Hence the total number of connected graphs is $140+40+6=186$.
    
    % QUESTION 4
    \item[4.] Let
    \[
        n = \prod_{i=1}^{k} p_i^{a_i}
    \]
    be the prime decomposition of $n$. Then the number of divisors of $n$ is
    equal to
    \[
        (a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1)(a_3 + 1) \cdots (a_k + 1).
    \]

    This must be equal to $9$, and so we can see that $n$ must either be of the
    form $n = p^8$ for some prime number $p$, or of the form $n = p^2 q^2$ for
    some distinct prime numbers $p$ and $q$. It remains to show that both of
    these cases work.

    For $n = p^8$, we have the following arrangement of its factors:
    \[
        \begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
            \hline
            p^3 & p^8 & p \\
            \hline
            p^2 & p^4 & p^6 \\
            \hline
            p^7 & 1 & p^5 \\
            \hline
        \end{array}
    \]

    For $n = p^2 q^2$, we have the following arrangement of its factors:
    \[
        \begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
            \hline
            p^2 q & q^2 & p \\
            \hline
            1 & p q & p^2 q^2 \\
            \hline
            pq^2 & p^2 & q \\
            \hline
        \end{array}
    \]
