\item[1.] % Croatia 2017 1st round 3.4
Find all pairs $(m,n)$ of positive integers which satisfy the equation
  \[ mn^2 = 100(n+1). \]


\item[2.] % Ukraine 2016/7 3rd Round Grade 8 Q4
Point $M$ and $N$ are chosen on the sides $BC$ and $CD$ of a square $ABCD$, respectively, so that $\angle MAN = 45^\circ$. Points $P$ and $Q$ are the intersections of the diagonal $BD$ with $AM$ and $AN$, respectively. Prove that $P$ and $Q$ lie on the circle with diameter $MN$.


\item[3.] % Nathalie Shwarz
Consider an 8-by-8 chessboard with 17 pieces placed on it in separate squares. Prove that there are three of these pieces which lie in three different rows and three different columns.


\item[4.] % Ukraine 2016/7 3rd round Grade 10 Q2
Find all functions $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ such that for all $x,y \in \mathbb{R}$,
  \[ f(x+f(f(y))) = y+f(f(x)). \]


\item[5.] % AoPS
Find all primes $p$ such that $\displaystyle \frac{2^{p-1}-1}{p}$ is the square of an integer.
 

\item[6.] % IGO 2016/7 Elementary Q3
Let $ABCD$ be a convex quadrilateral with no parallel sides. Make a parallelogram on each two consecutive sides. Show that among these 4 new points, there is only one point inside quadrilateral $ABCD$.
