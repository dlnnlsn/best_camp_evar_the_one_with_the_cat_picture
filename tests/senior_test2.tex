A snake trader has 2017 ravenous snakes with different tail lengths which he wants to place in a line from west to east, with each snake facing either east or west. The snakes are well-trained and will stay still once placed, but each will eat any snake it can see that has a shorter tail than it! (Each snake can see all the snakes in the direction in which it is facing.) Can the snakes be lined up such that no snake can see another snake with a shorter tail length? If so, how many ways are there to do this?

\item[3.] % EGMO 2012 Q1
Let $ABC$ be a triangle with circumcentre $O$. The points $D,E,F$ lie in the interiors of the sides $BC,CA,AB$ respectively, such that $DE$ is perpendicular to $CO$ and $DF$ is perpendicular to $BO$. (By interior we mean, for example, that the point $D$ lies on the line $BC$ and $D$ is between $B$ and $C$ on that line.) Let $K$ be the circumcentre of triangle $AFE$. Prove that the lines $DK$ and $BC$ are perpendicular.

\item[4.] % 
Let $P$ be a monic cubic polynomial with roots $a$, $b$ and $c$. If $P(1) = 91$ and $P(-1) = -121$, compute the maximum possible value of
	\[\frac{ab+bc+ca}{abc+a+b+c}.\]

\item[5.] % EGMO 2012 Q5
The numbers $p$ and $q$ are prime and satisfy
	\[\frac{p}{{p + 1}} + \frac{{q + 1}}{q} = \frac{{2n}}{{n + 2}}\]
for some positive integer $n$. Find all possible values of $q-p$.
