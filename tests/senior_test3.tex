There is a finite number of lamps in an electrical scheme. Some pairs of lamps are directly connected by a wire. Every lamp is lit either red or blue. With one switch all lamps that have a direct connection with a lmap of the other colour change their colour (from red to blue or vice versa). Prove that after some number of switches all lamps have the same colour as two switches before that.

Let $ a,b,c > 0$ such that $ abc = 1$ . Prove that :
    $$ \frac {ab}{a^2 + b^2 + \sqrt {c}} + \frac {bc}{b^2 + c^2 + \sqrt {a}} + \frac {ca}{c^2 + a^2 + \sqrt {b}}\le 1 $$
